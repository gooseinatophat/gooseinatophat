      An <b>intuitive</b>, 24h format, <b>timetable clock</b>. <br />Aimed at
      those of us who have to deal with <b>ADHD Time-Blindness</b> (or
      simmilar), <br /><b>"clock"</b> is designed for optimal processing of
      <b>visual output</b> in order to help us better <b>plan</b>, establish and
      <b>navigate</b> our <b>daily</b> schedules and routines.

      The "clock" Project started as an atempt at creating something I
      personally found I needed. During the process it became clear this had the
      potential to become an essential tool for others as well.
